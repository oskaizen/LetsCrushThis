#  Git 🆚 GitHub

💻 [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a [free and open source](https://git-scm.com/about/#free-and-open-source) distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

- Git is a version control system
- It runs on your computer. We say it runs **locally**. To be fancy, we could say it runs **on-prem** (on your local premises).
- It lets you:
    - Revert to older versions of `code`
    - Create branches during `code` development
    - Merge `code` written at different times or people
- Technically, there are other distributed version control systems. These can be seen as alternatives to Git. However, *for all intents and purposes, **there are no alternatives** for someone getting started in software development today*.

☁️ [GitHub](http://github.com/) is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code.

- GitHub is a website (platform) that hosts Git repositories in the cloud
- It uses Git, and has extra features like
    - Storing repos for you on their computers. We say they are hosted **remotely**.
    - Collaboration tools like [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) and [code review](https://github.com/features/code-review)
    - and more…
- While alternatives to GitHub do exist - like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/) - understanding the core patterns will allow you to pick up any other tool.
